Alright, deep breath… we got this, captain. You’re laying solid groundwork, and it’s totally okay to feel like you’re in the thick of the jungle right now. Let’s break it down into digestible chunks and sort out your plan like a proper full-stack boss. 🧩⚡

---

### 🧭 1. **Where does Supabase redirect after email verification?**

In your code:

```ts
emailRedirectTo: `${location.origin}/auth/callback`
```

So it’s sending users to:  
**`http://localhost:3000/auth/callback`** (or your production domain + `/auth/callback`)

That’s where you'll need to:
- Handle the session (check if the user is logged in)
- Check if they’re already in the database
- Create their profile if they’re logging in for the first time
- Then redirect them to the dashboard

---

### 🧱 2. **What you need to build next (in order)**

#### ✅ Step 1: Handle `/auth/callback`
Make a page: `pages/auth/callback.tsx` or `app/auth/callback/page.tsx` (depending on routing system)

Inside it:
- Grab the user session from Supabase
- If logged in, check your Supabase DB `users` table for that UID
- If user doesn’t exist → insert new profile
- Then: redirect to `/dashboard`

---

#### 🧑‍💼 Step 2: User Profile & Dashboard

Make a **`users`** table in Supabase:
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY,
  email text UNIQUE,
  firstname text,
  lastname text,
  created_at timestamp default now()
);
```

Then in your callback page, after successful auth:

```ts
const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser();
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from("users")
  .select("*")
  .eq("id", user.id)
  .single();

if (!data) {
  await supabase.from("users").insert({
    id: user.id,
    email: user.email,
    firstname: user.user_metadata.firstname,
    lastname: user.user_metadata.lastname
  });
}
router.push("/dashboard");
```

---

#### 💼 Step 3: `/dashboard` Page

- Protected route (only logged-in users should see it)
- Show welcome message using their name
- Later on: display stats, recent activity, progress, etc.

---

### 🧼 3. **Fix: "Login / Register still visible after login"**

You'll need a `UserContext` or `useSession()` hook to:
- Show login/register when not logged in
- Show profile/logout when logged in

Simple example using Supabase:

```ts
const { data: { session } } = await supabase.auth.getSession();

if (session) {
  // user is logged in → show dashboard/profile/logout
} else {
  // show login/register
}
```

---

### 🧠 4. **What’s missing (but you’ll need soon)**

- 🔒 Route Protection (auth guard)
- 🎨 Personalized dashboard (using `users` table)
- 📦 Centralized user context/state
- 📥 Profile edit page (change name, etc.)
- 📃 Settings page
- 🌐 Auth-aware navbar
